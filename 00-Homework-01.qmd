# Homework #1 

::: info-block
<div class="title">How to deliver</div>
Please deliver the answer to this homework in a single PDF file. Use figures, but try to keep it under three pages.
:::

## 1 - Identify Yourself!

Think about your expectatives about this course. Which one(s) of the descriptions in [What is a data scientist? 14 definitions of a data scientist!](https://crayondata.ai/what-is-a-data-scientist-14-definitions-of-a-data-scientist/) applies to you? Which one(s) doesn't? 

A local PDF of that site is stored [here](Resources/References/WhatIsADataScientist.pdf).

## 2 - Find Open Data.

Find a source of _open data_ on the web. Try to get a source of data that you can relate to.
Write one or two paragraphs about what it contains, who publishes it, what it can used for. 

Get at least one of the files from that source. How easy/hard was it? How well-documented is it? Does it looks tidy?

<div class="title">Hint</div>
If you cannot find good open data sources and if you can read Portuguese you can always check up some government data sources, e.g.
[Portal Brasileiro de Dados Abertos](https://dados.gov.br/home), 
[Portal da Transparência - Controladoria Geral da União](https://portaldatransparencia.gov.br/download-de-dados), 
[Governo Aberto SP](https://www.governoaberto.sp.gov.br/
), [Portal de
Dados Abertos do Ministério da Educação](https://dadosabertos.mec.gov.br/),
[Catálogo de Dados Abertos do Senado Federal](https://www12.senado.leg.br/dados-abertos/dados-abertos/catalogo-de-dados-abertos),
[ipeadata](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx)
[Dados Abertos da Agência Nacional de Águas e Saneamento Básico](https://dadosabertos.ana.gov.br/).

## 3 - Choose an environment.

Check out [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [SciServer](https://apps.sciserver.org/dashboard/) or other online notebook environments, play with them a little and select one (or more!) to write notebooks for this class.<br>
Alternatively, if you prefer, you can run your code locally. This tutorial on [Sharing Notebooks](https://rafaeldcsantos.github.io/SharingNotebooks/Intro.html) may help.
