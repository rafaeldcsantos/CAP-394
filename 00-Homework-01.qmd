# Homework #1 

::: info-block
<div class="title">How to deliver</div>
Please deliver the answer to this homework in a single PDF file. Use figures, but try to keep it under three pages.
:::

## 1 - Identify Yourself!

Think about your expectatives about this course. Which one(s) of the descriptions in [What is a data scientist? 14 definitions of a data scientist!](https://crayondata.ai/what-is-a-data-scientist-14-definitions-of-a-data-scientist/) applies to you? Which one(s) doesn't? 

A local PDF of that site is stored [here](Resources/References/WhatIsADataScientist.pdf).

## 2 - Find Open Data.

Find a source of _open data_ on the web. 
Write one or two paragraphs about what it contains, who publishes it, what it can used for. 

Get at least one of the files from that source. How easy/hard was it? How well-documented is it? Does it looks tidy?

## 3 - Choose an environment.

Check out [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [SciServer](https://apps.sciserver.org/dashboard/) or other online notebook environments, play with them a little and select one (or more!) to write notebooks for this class.<br>
Alternatively, if you prefer, you can run your code locally. This tutorial on [Sharing Notebooks](https://rafaeldcsantos.github.io/SharingNotebooks/Intro.html) may help.
