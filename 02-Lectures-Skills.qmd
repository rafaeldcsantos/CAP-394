## Code for examples used in this lecture

### Average Temperature Basic Example

In this notebook we will do a very simple data science project: plot the Earth's average land temperature and see if it is getting higher. The original data came from the [Berkeley Earth site](http://berkeleyearth.org/), an independent U.S. non-profit organization focused on environmental data science. The original data file can be [downloaded here](http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/auto/Global/Complete_TAVG_summary.txt) or [here (a local copy)](Resources/Data/AverageTemperature/Complete_TAVG_summary.txt). It is a text file with annual and five-year average temperatures and respective uncertainties.

The first 30 lines of that file are shown below:

% This file contains a brief summary of the land-surface average results 
% produced by the Berkeley Averaging method.  Temperatures are in 
% Celsius and reported as anomalies relative to the Jan 1951-Dec 1980
% average. Uncertainties represent the 95% confidence interval for 
% statistical and spatial undersampling effects.

% The current dataset presented here is described as:

  1756      -0.421        1.596           -0.831           0.586
  1757      -0.310        0.896           -1.024           0.612
  1758      -2.345        1.366           -1.347           0.882
``` 

Let's use Python [@python2001], Pandas [@pandasmckinney2012] and Matplotlib [@matplotlibhunter2007] for the analysis scripts, which will read the data and plot the year versus the corrected annual average temperature, and after that let's see if we can see a trend using a basic linear model.

First we import the libraries we're going to use.

```{python}
#| classes: custompython
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```
 
Now we can read the file into a data frame -- more on this later in the course. If you want to reproduce this make sure you have the file in the right path.
Note that we have to explicitely name the columns for this data set. 
 
```{python}
#| classes: custompython
inputfile = "Resources/Data/AverageTemperature/Complete_TAVG_summary.txt"
data = pd.read_csv(inputfile,sep="\\s+",skiprows=22,header=None)
data.columns = ["Year","Annual.Anomaly","Annual.Uncertainty",
                "FiveYear.Anomaly","FiveYear.Uncertainty"]
```
 
Let's see how the data looks (as a data frame):

```{python}
#| classes: custompython
 data 
```

We want to plot the temperature, but we have the anomaly. All we need to do is to add 8.65ÂºC to the anomaly (see a detailed explanation at [this NASA's Earth Observatory site](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/global-temperatures) or [NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/dyk/anomalies-vs-temperature)).

```{python}
#| classes: custompython
data["Annual"] = data["Annual.Anomaly"]+8.65
```

Now let's plot the annual temperature against the year:

```{python}
#| classes: custompython
ax = data.plot(kind="line",x="Year",y="Annual")
plt.show()
```

Let's fit a linear regression model that will basically describe temperature a function of the year using the data we have. Don't worry about the math details for the time being.  

```{python}
#| classes: custompython
model = LinearRegression()
X = pd.DataFrame(data["Year"])
Y = pd.DataFrame(data["Annual"])
model.fit(X,Y)
Y_pred = model.predict(X)
```

`Y_pred` contains the predicted temperature values from the years. We can now create another plot that shows the original data and the linear model as a straigth line in red.

```{python}
#| classes: custompython
plt.plot(data["Year"],data["Annual"])
plt.plot(data["Year"],Y_pred,color="red")
plt.show()
```
