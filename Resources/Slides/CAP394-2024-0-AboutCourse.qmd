![Basically how we will manage the course. Lectures can be online depending on the schedule and on where I will be on the lecture’s day, but may also be in-person – do not consider this course as being fully online!<br>Important: we will do some projects together to undestand the issues in a data science project but the students will also need to propose and execute a capstone project!](Resources/Slides/CAP394-2024-0-AboutCourse-Slide4.png){.lightbox group="CAP394-2024-0-AboutCourse"}

![I’m online (e-mail) basically every day, almost all the time, but don’t have too much free time for meetings. Plan ahead!](Resources/Slides/CAP394-2024-0-AboutCourse-Slide5.png){.lightbox group="CAP394-2024-0-AboutCourse"}
