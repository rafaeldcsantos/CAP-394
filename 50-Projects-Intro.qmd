# Introduction

This section will contain some Data Science Projects that are used in our lectures.

Projects are somehow complex tasks around a specific dataset that requires data wrangling, organization, EDA, visualization, and in some cases application of machine learning techniques. 

Most projects will include ideas for class discussions and several exercises. 

Projects that are ready to be explored are on the sidebar on the left. Many of those projects are incomplete: identifying further development possibilities is left as an exercise to the students.
