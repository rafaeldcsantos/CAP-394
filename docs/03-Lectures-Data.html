<div class="hidden" aria-hidden="true">
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-1">Today’s lecture will be about Data.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-2">Here’s are our main topics.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-3">Just as an exercise, try to explain data yourself. Avoid self-references!</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-4">A very, very short definition of “data” for our purposes (“analyzing data”). It uses “information” which can be interpreted as “organized data”.<br>Another definition is “collection of values that convey information”. </span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-5">Raw Data is the most common data type on the Web (and off it too) – data that was collected and put online or stored, without any preprocessing, annotations or even metadata.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-6">I got this from “An overview of a dataset digitized by citizen science volunteers – the 1900-1910 Daily Weather Reports“ (https://blogs.reading.ac.uk/weather-and-climate-at-reading/2020/an-overview-of-a-dataset-digitized-by-citizen-science-volunteers-the-1900-1910-daily-weather-reports/) – very interesting read! Humans collected the data by hand, then, many years later, digitized it using Citizen Science.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-7">This are the daily measures of the level on Rio Ladário, part of the Paraguay River Basin. You can get its PDF from the “Centro deHidrografia e Navegação do Oeste - MARINHA DO BRASIL” website (https://www.marinha.mil.br/chn-6/?q=alturaAnterioresRios).<br>There is probably a spreadsheet version of this PDF somewhere. But it is usable?<br>The raw (useful!) data is somewhere at https://www.snirh.gov.br/hidroweb/serieshistoricas</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-8">Both figures show data – in a very organized way. The table is the list of graduate courses approved by CAPES, the figure is a histogram plot based on the data (with some small differences due to the time the data was collected). The data is shown as a HTML table. <br>The chart is part of a report for the Engineering’s III Evaluation Group.<br>Tables can be represented in text files, spreadsheets, XML and other formats.But it is still not perfect data for us – how to we query those?</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-9">From the Portal de Imigração Laboral of MINISTÉRIO DA JUSTIÇA E SEGURANÇA PÚBLICA (https://portaldeimigracao.mj.gov.br/pt/dados/dados-consolidados1) we can get data from immigrants in Brazil. The “plano tabular” is a spreadsheet with summaries but may not be useful for most queries – we need the full data set that was used to create those summaries.<br>We can get it from the DataMigra portal (https://www.datamigraweb.unb.br/#/public), option “SOLICITANTES DE REFÚGIO”. <br><br></span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-10">This section is a general discussion of what data can represent measures from the world, how it represents and how it is stored. <br>It is a prelude to some notes on data transformation eventually leading to EDA and machine learning.<br>In most of the cases we would like to deal with tables, but this is not always possible…</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-11">Here’s an example of the different ways to consider data:<br>Structure of Data: How the data is logically organized (e.g., rows representing municipalities and columns representing features of those municipalities such as area, population, and other attributes).<br>Representation of Data: The format or schema used to express the data (e.g., a table with rows and columns, CSV format, JSON format).<br>Storage of Data: The physical or digital medium and file format used to save the data (e.g., flat text file, spreadsheet, database).</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-12">This is our most basic data representation scheme: a collection of tuples, where each tuple element (the table column) contains measurements of some features of an object (the table lines).<br>In this example we have a tuple on the format V1, V2, V3 .. VN, Value (where the combination V1, VN… may not be unique).<br>We can easily imagine some operation on the tuples, e.g.&nbsp;find all values for a specific combination of “Localidade do gasto” and “Nome Função”.This is the “Emendas Parlamentares” dataset, we’ll play with it later! Get it at https://portaldatransparencia.gov.br/download-de-dados/emendas-parlamentares</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-13">This is our most basic data representation scheme: a collection of tuples. <br>In this example we also have tuples on the format V1, V2, V3 .. VN, Value (where the combination V1, VN… may be unique).<br>It is easy to consider combination or aggregation operations on the tuples, for example, counting the immigrants from a country in a state, regardless of sex.<br>This is the “Migration” dataset, we’ll play with it later!<br></span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-14">Time series are data: there is a temporal index that set an explicit order to it. Usually are represented as tuples of time -&gt; value1, value2, valueN. We expect the time to be unique.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-15">Yet another collection of tuples but with a twist. <br>Not only there are tuples for each participant in a project but the mapping of participants into projects is a graph, a different type of data that can be represented by tuples.<br>This is the “CAPES-Projetos” dataset, we’ll play with it later!<br></span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-16">Here’s a region of the table that corresponds to a single project. We can consider each combination of ID_PESSOA within the same ID_PROJETO to be vertices in a network with the project being an edge.<br>The additional material on https://rafaeldcsantos.github.io/CAP-394 shows how we can do it.<br></span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-17">This is a single entry from a log of SQL queries submitted to an astronomy database. It is textual data, semistructured, that could be converted into tabular data with some tricks. We may see some of those later.<br>Logs are also usually stored in text files.<br>MAKIYAMA, V. H. Text mining applied to SQL queries: a case study for SDSS SkyServer. 2015. 75 p.&nbsp;IBI: &lt;8JMKD3MGP3W34P/3K6JNQ8&gt;. (sid.inpe.br/mtc-m21b/2015/08.31.17.43-TDI). Dissertação (Mestrado em Computação Aplicada) - Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), São José dos Campos, 2015. Disponível em: <a href="http://urlib.net/ibi/8JMKD3MGP3W34P/3K6JNQ8" class="uri">http://urlib.net/ibi/8JMKD3MGP3W34P/3K6JNQ8</a>.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-18">A structured text data. XML is a format that allows representation of structured and semi-structured data using tags and hierarchies. JSON is a similar format. <br>These formats can be read (with some difficulty…) by humans and computers. They are usually stored in text files.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-19">Images are data that are spatially organized, and for which we expect some coherence (e.g visible patterns).<br>These are Synthetic-aperture radar images. Images on the first column show waves; on the second column we have some biological slicks (algae?) and the images on the third column show icebergs. <br>Images are from a dataset associated with the paper “A labelled ocean SAR imagery dataset of ten geophysical phenomena from Sentinel‐1 wave model”.<br>There are many ways to represent image data in a file format, and many formats that allow the specific representation of specialized data (e.g.&nbsp;color images, 2D signals, multispectral images…)<br>Multimedia data cannot be used directly into machine learning algorithms: we must extract features of it beforehand, which often is not a trivial task.<br>Movies and audio are other types of multimedia data which also requires feature extraction.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-20">When dealing with data obtained from the Web try to get also a data dictionary, a document that describes what the data contains (metadata!)One common example of feature creation from data: if we have a timestamp, we can process it to get fields for days, hours, etc., possibly expanding to get information for days of the week and working hours, for example.<br>Context is much more subtle: it is not part of data nor metadata, but may give important information about it.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-21">Tidy Data is the best possible representation of data for exploration and analysis. It allow us to keep an organized representation of the data. This is not always possible, as we’ll see.<br>The best reference for Tidy Data is “Tidy Data”, Hadley Wickham, https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-22">Basically, we would like our data to look like a spreadsheet: each row represents an observation; each column represents one (and only one!) measure or variable on that observation. For this analogy to work we expect that the first row in the spreadsheet contains the names of the variables!<br>Please refer to R for Data Science (2e), https://r4ds.hadley.nz/, for a more detailed description.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-23">Does it look like a spreadsheet? It is probably tidy (but check for the single-value-in-a-cell rule!)<br>Images can be considered tidy, but the semantics are very different – we don’t use pixels as values, usually there are some preprocessing steps first.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-24">In wide format data, each variable is spread out across columns. It is better for reading by humans, some visualization and machine learning tasks. It can have missing data in its cells.In long format data, each row is an observation and there are fewer columns. It is better for subsetting, it is tidier and more economic.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-25">Our supermarket data looks like a spreadsheet, looks tidy but could be made tidier – at what cost?<br>Tidiness is also somehow relative. Consider what is a record: in this example it is an item being sold so the data is tidy-ish. If we consider transactions as the data represented than the data is somehow less tidy.<br></span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-26">We have the data, possibly raw, hopefully tidy. We may need to change its shape to process it. Let’s talk about data shapes and transformations!</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-27">Let’s think about the parliamentary amendments (”Emendas Parlamentares”) dataset. Each entry happened in one date (year), had an author, a code for the function, a place for the destination of the amendment and a value. On a 4-dimensional data cube we could have Year, Author, Code, Place for the dimensions and Value as the value stored in the cell. Using this way of representation, we could do some simple operations that allows exploration of the data, but on the other hand, conceptually, the cube could be made of mostly empty cells.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-28">We can slice a N-dimensional data cube creating a (N-1)-dimensional data cube. Consider this as an operation that selects all records where a feature is equal to a single value. Considering the amendments example, we can slice the data cube getting all records for a particular year or for a particular place for the destination. The resulting dataset can be considered a new one (e.g.&nbsp;Amendments for 2014) and the feature used for the slicing can be discarded, since all data will have the same value for this feature.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-29">This is basically the same – slicing can be done in any dimensions of the data cube. This would be the slicing of all amendments that will be used in a specific location. We can, of course, slice again cubes that were already sliced further reducing its dimension (e.g.&nbsp;all amendment for a year and to be used in a place).</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-30">Dicing is slightly different from slicing: when we dice a data cube, we keep the same number of dimensions but get a reduced data set. Consider for example getting all amendments for a range of years and set of locations. The resulting data needs to keep the features used for dicing since we may have more than one value for those.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-31">Pivoting data is a bit more complex: it uses the values of the features to create new columns and is usually done to summarize data.<br>When we pivot data, we can use different operations to create the pivoted table cell’s values. In this case we could use “sum” to sum the values for all cells with the same Local, Categoria and Ano.</span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-32">Here is another example of pivoting: each project in the “CAPES-Projetos” dataset is spread out into several lines. I could pivot those to count how many members of each type each project contains. We’ll see in the examples!<br></span>
<span class="glightbox-desc lightbox-desc-33">Drilling up is basically aggregation and counting. Drilling down is the opposite. We can only drill down if there is data to be used to show more details.<br>For example, I cannot drill down the table in this slide because I don’t have how to add more information to get finer details. But if I had the full date instead of they year I could break it into day, month, year and do something conceptually similar to a drill down.<br></span>
