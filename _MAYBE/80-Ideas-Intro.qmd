# Introduction

This section will contain some Data Science ideas that _may_ be used in our lectures.

Ideas are similar to [projects](50-Projects-Intro.qmd) but weren't thoroughly explored. They will require more effort on data acquisition, organization, etc. before EDA and analysis can be done.

Ideas that are ready to be explored are on the sidebar on the left.
